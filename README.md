### Setup

1. **Clone the repository and create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd mcp-starter
   uv venv
   uv sync
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update:

   ```env
   AUTH_TOKEN=your_secret_auth_token
   MY_NUMBER=919876543210
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

   - `AUTH_TOKEN`: Secret token for API authentication
   - `MY_NUMBER`: Your WhatsApp number in international format (e.g., `919876543210`)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI key for the interview coach tool

3. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   python mcp_starter.py
   ```

   Server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:8086`
